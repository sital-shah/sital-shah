Terminology
-----------
1. REPO = Repository - storage unit, like a folder which holds all files belonging to a project including project versions and revision history
2. CLONING - copying a version of the code in that repository on the GitHub servers onto your local machine
3. FORK - copy someone else's repository on to your GitHub account
4. COMMIT - individual revision to your local copy of the repository
5. PUSH - send the changes you've made on your local copy up to the remote repository on GitHub to share with other
6. PULL - obtain changes from the remote repository on GitHub to your local copy
7. PULL REQUEST - set of proposed changes by a user on the repository that can be accepted or rejected by other members of the repository
8. BRANCHES - different versions of the code that are active at the same time in the online repository 
            - each branch being a separate version of the code which can be used in parallel without breaking the live version
9. MERGES - combining two branches together, so different features of each branch will be both active on one version of the code

Benefits of GitHub
------------------
+ Multiple versions of the code and multiple users can work on the code simultaneously
+ Serves as a backup storage for your local code as it will be available on the online repository
+ Useful tracking issue or bugs and assigning improvements to different people on the team
+ Hosts repositories from data scientists across industries and around the world
